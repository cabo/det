Those sections of 8949 are a bit complicated for readers, so this draft should be simple.\r\n\r\nSo far the only proposed profile is dCBOR.

          "body": "Thanks!  I think the most valuable part here is the table at the end.\r\nThe explanation probably should first explain that CBOR supports IEEE 754, what a NaN is, that a NaN always has a payload, and which payload values aren't available because they would mean something different than a NaN.  A quick discussion of the quiet/signaling bit, the fact that IEEE 754 doesn't define it, but there is a de facto standard needs to follow, and then we can introduce the \"basic\" NaN with sign 0, quiet bit 1, all other payload bits zero.  The reason why some applications are not using `foo = float / null` or `foo = float / payload` where payload can be anything but float.  Then a quick discussion of implementation considerations for preferred serialization, including the weirdness that two NaNs do not compare equal in most platforms, even if they are equal wrt to their payloads.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this shouldn't be a separate draft, to which CDE could refer for information.\r\nIt's night here already, but I could turn your input and the above outline into a draft about NaN and CBOR.",
